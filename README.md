# Home_Sales

## Introduction
In this project, we harness the power of PySpark and Spark SQL on Google Colab to analyze a dataset containing home sales information. By employing advanced data processing techniques, we aim to derive key metrics and insights from the data.

## Project Overview
1. Data Analysis with PySpark:
  - We leverage PySpark and its SQL capabilities to perform intricate analysis on the home sales dataset.
  - Through Spark SQL, we efficiently query and transform the data to answer critical questions.
2. Temporary Views and Data Manipulation:
  - Utilizing Spark, we create temporary views for streamlined data querying.
  - We explore techniques to manipulate and aggregate the data to extract meaningful insights.
3. Data Partitioning and Optimization:
  - We delve into the process of partitioning the data to enhance query performance.
  - By strategically organizing the data, we enable faster access to specific subsets.
4. Caching and Uncaching:
  - We explore the concept of caching a temporary table for optimized query performance.
  - Additionally, we learn how to efficiently uncache the data when no longer needed.

## Key Metrics Explored
1. Average Price for Four-Bedroom Houses:
  - We address the question: "What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?"
  - Spark SQL assists in calculating and rounding off this critical metric.
2. Average Price of Homes by Year Built and Specifications:
  - We explore the query: "What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?"
  - Additionally, we extend this to consider homes with specific specifications like two floors and a minimum size of 2,000 square feet.
3. "View" Ratings for High-Value Homes:
  - We investigate the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000.
  - By utilizing Spark, we determine this rating and compute its run time for analysis.

## Conclusion
Through the integration of PySpark, Spark SQL, and Google Colab, this project empowers us to perform sophisticated analysis on large-scale datasets. The insights gained from our data exploration contribute to a deeper understanding of home sales trends and metrics. We also delve into the technical aspects of data optimization, caching, and uncache, which are crucial skills for handling big data effectively.
